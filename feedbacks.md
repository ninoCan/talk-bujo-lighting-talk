1. **Some examples** would have help me to understand better
2. I agree! I already knew BuJos and they can be very either contentful or very simple,
   but still they are all amazing. **show them off**
3. You have character, it showed with your laughter at the beginning,
   but somehow **you lost the stage** and retreated in the final parts
4. It felt a bit abstract to me, so I also think the examples would have helped understand what BuJos are better
5. I knew BuJos, and I'm not yet convinced it fits my style.
   Yet, it felt like you were selling me a product.
   So, you could have **add a personal story** about your journey into BuJos
(Q: is the guy who invented BuJos-Ryder Carroll- a friend of yours?)
6. Make the **text bigger** it could not be seen clearly from the last row
7. use **black on white** themes
8. I saw you were using VisualStudio Code and markdown, that's fine.
   Moreover, it took a while for starting the presentation.
   The point is **own your tools**. Looking snappy is a great way to look confident
9. Ok, that you are not a native English speaker but STOP. Absolutely, **stop humming**. Be silent instead!
10. Use **silence** tactically **to emphasize content**.
