# 🧠 What Is It?

* Invented by [Ryder Carroll](https://bulletjournal.com)
* Combines:

  * ✅ To-do list
  * 📔 Diary
  * 📅 Planner
  * 🎨 Sketchbook
* A flexible analog method also called **BuJo**

<!--
Start with a personal hook: 

Ever felt like digital tools were
**too much** ? 
The Bullet Journal helped me
reclaim my focus and time.
-->

# ✍️ Rapid Logging

* Use quick bullets to capture thoughts:

  * `•` Task
  * `x` Completed
  * `>` Migrated
  * `o` Event
  * `!` Note

👉 This makes logging fast and structured

<!--
"This method helps me jot down without overthinking."
